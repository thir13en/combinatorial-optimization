# SEG Vanilla JS boilerplate
A boilerplate for working with VanillaJS projects, carefully developed by SEG department (SOFTWARE ENGINEERING GROUP) 
within [i2cat foundation](https://www.i2cat.net/#home).  
You can start cooking your spaghetti... Buen provecho!

This repository relies on yarn as a JS package manager, Webpack as a module bundler
and Babel as a pre-processed language transpiler.

###Dependencies
First, you need to install yarn on your local machine, to do so, follow the instructions provided in 
https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install.

Make sure you have installed yarn properly running the command
```yarn --version```.

### Install local dependencies
To install local dependencies, simply run:
```yarn install```


### Development and Production environments
Create a development build by running: ``` yarn run dev ```.

When you are ready to go, build the production dist file by running ```yarn run build```
